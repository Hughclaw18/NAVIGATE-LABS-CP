### üîÑ Detailed System Data Flow

Ever wondered how we turn video feeds into intelligent alerts? Here's the journey your data takes through our system:

1. **Video Ingestion Layer**: 
   - First stop: Your video enters from RTSP cameras, uploaded files, or webcams
   - For RTSP streams, our RTSPtoWeb service transforms them into web-friendly formats
   - Each frame is carefully extracted and queued for AI processing

2. **AI Processing Pipeline**:
   - Every frame gets the VIP treatment‚Äîanalyzed by three specialized CV models simultaneously
   - Our violence detector spots aggressive behaviors with impressive accuracy
   - The pose estimator tracks human movement and calculates joint angles to detect falls or unusual postures
   - Meanwhile, our anomaly detector is scanning for dangerous objects like fire, smoke, or weapons
   - Each detection is counted, timestamped, and stored for pattern recognition

3. **Alert Processing Workflow**:
   - When something suspicious crosses our threshold, an alert springs into action
   - We capture the frame, highlight the detection, and generate a time-series chart for context
   - The whole package‚Äîimage, chart, and alert message‚Äîis ready for delivery
   - A smart cooldown system prevents alert flooding (because nobody wants their phone buzzing non-stop)

4. **Data Storage and Management**:
   - Real-time counts stay in memory for instant dashboard updates
   - Historical events are carefully logged with timestamps for trend analysis
   - User preferences are securely stored in Supabase.

5. **Frontend Communication**:
   - Our React frontend stays in constant contact with the FastAPI backend
   - Video streams flow efficiently to your browser via WebRTC/HLS
   - Dashboard stats refresh automatically to keep you informed

6. **AI Assistant Integration**:
   - Meet REVA, your AI surveillance assistant built on the Agno framework
   - She has direct access to system data through a custom toolkit
   - Powered by Google Gemini, she understands natural language queries about your system
   - Chat with her through Telegram or the web interface‚Äîshe remembers your conversation context

This architecture delivers real-time monitoring with impressively low latency, while maintaining a modular design that can easily grow with your needs.

## üß© Components

### 1. Backend (api.py)

The brain of our operation‚Äîa FastAPI application that:

- Processes video streams using state-of-the-art CV models
- Manages user authentication and preferences
- Handles Telegram notifications with rich media
- Serves API endpoints for the frontend dashboard

### 2. Frontend

A responsive React interface that brings surveillance data to life:

- Secure user authentication flow
- High-performance video streaming player
- Interactive analytics dashboard with filtering
- Customizable settings management
- Simple local media upload interface

### 3. RTSPtoWeb

Instead of bundling our own solution, we integrate with the excellent [RTSPtoWeb](https://github.com/deepch/RTSPtoWeb) open-source project. This Go service:

- Converts RTSP camera streams to web-friendly formats
- Provides HTTP, WebRTC, and HLS endpoints for browser compatibility
- Enables efficient web viewing of IP camera feeds
- Handles stream authorization and security

### 4. CV Models Used

Our system leverages three cutting-edge detection models:

- **YOLO Violence Detection**: Fine-tuned on a large set of dataset to identify aggressive actions and confrontations
- **YOLOv8 Pose Estimation**: Maps human body keypoints to detect falls and unusual postures
- **YOLOE Segmentation**: Leverages the use of visual prompts for efficient detetctions and segmentations, removing the necessity of mentioning fixed label categories and fine-tuning.

### 5. AI Assistant

Meet REVA, your surveillance companion:

- Built on the Agno framework, a powerful agent-based AI platform
- Powered by Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model for natural conversations
- Equipped with a custom toolkit to access real-time surveillance metrics
- Maintains conversation history in SQLite for personalized interactions
- Available through Telegram for on-the-go system monitoring
- Ask her anything from "How many alerts today?" to "Show me detection trends"
